    Isolate global state in ScoutConfig and TrackedRequest.

    Since scout_apm relies heavily on global variables, it's unfortunately
    easy to leak state changes after a test, which can affect later tests.
    This fixture acts as a safety net. It checks after each test if global
    state was properly reset. If not, it fails the test.

    (An alternative would be to clean up here rather than in each test. The
    original author of this fixture is uncomfortable with such an implicit
    behavior. He prefers enforcing an explicit clean up in tests, requiring
    developers to understand how their test affects global state.)

    RequestManager and RequestBuffer aren't convered because the current
    implementation doesn't buffer anything.
