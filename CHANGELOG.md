## [2.16.1] 2020-09-09

### Fixed

- Added a cast to string of query parameters, to work around cases where
  application code changes them to non-strings. Fixes a possible exception:
  `AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'encode'` in
  `scout.core.web_requests`.

## [2.16.0] 2020-09-08

### Added

- Changed default agent connection to use TCP rather than a unix socket. By
  default the agent will be run on 127.0.0.1, port 6590. This should resolve
  a number of connection issues. To continue using a socket connection,

  session data access.
  ([Issue #544](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/544))

## [2.15.1] 2020-07-23

### Fixed

- Always convert `collect_remote_ip` to boolean.

  template in Django 3.1 will set.
  ([Issue #503](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/503))
- Instrument new Elasticsearch methods `get_script_context()` and
  `get_script_languages()`.
  ([PR #507](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/507))
- Prevent output from the core agent when starting it.
  ([Issue #510](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/510))

## [2.13.0] 2020-03-09

### Added

- Added config value `shutdown_message_enabled` /
  `SCOUT_SHUTDOWN_MESSAGE_ENABLED` which can be set to "false" to disable the
  shutdown message "Scout draining N events..."that was added in version

  ([Issue #498](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/498))
- Renamed `config_file`, `log_file`, and `socket_path` to have the
  `core_agent_` prefix. This is to clarify that they apply only to the core
  agent process. The old names continue to work as aliases.
  ([Issue #497](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/497))
- Improved some log messages and levels around instrumentation.
  ([Issue #502](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/502))

## [2.12.0] 2020-03-03

### Added

- Added ability to read configuration from your Celery app. This can help share
  configuration between Django and Celery. Pass your application as `app` to
  have the configuration copied: `scout_apm.celery.install(app=app)` .
  ([Issue #477](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/477))
- Added maximum span limit of 1500. This prevents memory exhaustion when
  tracing long running tasks as Scout no longer tries to record everything.
  ([Issue #472](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/472))

### Fixed

- Made installation of the objtrace C extension optional, so that if it fails
  due to your C compiler being old, Scout can still install.
  ([Issue #488](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/488))
- Removed warning for setting the `SCOUT_LOG_LEVEL` setting, since this is set
  by default by the Heroku add-on.
  ([Issue #486](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/486]))

## [2.11.0] 2020-02-17

- Limit size of recorded tracebacks to reduce memory usage.
  ([PR #476](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/476))
- Scout now flushes any queued commands to the core agent at shutdown, with a
  configurable timeout `shutdown_timeout_seconds`, defaulting to 2 seconds.
  This ensures that all traces are recorded, rather than lost, especially
  useful for single-run background commands.
  ([Issue # 473](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/473))
- Move from **requests** to underlying **urllib3** for downloads to reduce
  dependency footprint.
  ([PR #480](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/480))
- Retry downloading the core agent a few times, and use a timeout to prevent
  startup hangs.
  ([PR #480](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/480))

### Fixed

- Moved some user-facing warnings, such as for deprecated features, from
  `logging` to `warnings`, so they can be caught during testing.
  ([PR #468](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/468))
- Fix Jinja2 asynchronous rendering instrumentation for Jinja2 2.11.0+.
  ([PR #462](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/462))

- Fix for `elasticsearch` version 7.5.1's change of positional argument order.
  ([Issue #456](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/issues/456))

## [2.10.0] 2020-01-02

### Added

- Use Python 3.8's standard library `importlib.metadata.distributions()` to
  determine package versions, rather than `pkg_resources`. The [backport
  package
  `importlib_metadata`](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/) is
  required on older Python versions.
  ([PR #430](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/430))

  ([PR #299](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/299)).

## [2.6.0] 2019-10-22

### Deprecated

- The `log_level` configuration option is deprecated. Please use the new name
  `core_agent_log_level` instead
  ([PR #273](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/273)).

### Added

- Change default "path" tag on web requests to capture query parameters as
  well. This can be disabled by setting the config value `uri_reporting` to
  `"path"`
  ([PR #268](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/268),
  [PR #269](https://github.com/scoutapp/scout_apm_python/pull/269)).
